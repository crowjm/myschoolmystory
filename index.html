		<h1><span>Every child deserves a free, quality, public education.</span></h1>
		<p>Our nation’s founding fathers believed in the importance of public education. John Adams wrote, <q cite="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/why-public-education-must-be-preserved/2011/10/03/gIQAoabNJL_blog.html?utm_term=.ab03e8eb6bed">there should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained at the public expense of the people themselves.</q> Public education is one of the cornerstones of our democracy.</p>
		<p>My School, My Story began in response to President Trump’s nomination of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. Since she does not have any experience with public education, we want to share stories with her, and other lawmakers, to help them understand the importance of a strong public education system. If you have a story to share, <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Q3sroyECnQJFNO403">submit it here</a>.</p>
		<p>Imagine how much more America’s students could achieve if they had equitable access to resources, equipment, and facilities.</p>

			<p class="story__content">One of the teachers I remember most is my 6th grade history teacher. His classes were so engaging and he made sure we understood our history and its consequences, not just names and dates. He was a former Marine and a steadfast believer in our right to free speech. I know at least two of my former classmates joined the Marines in some part because of his influence. One of the things I remember most was the lottery system he had. If you made at least a B on our weekly quiz, you could enter your name in the lottery. Once a month, he would pick the winner. If you won, he would take you to Walmart/Kmart/Target and let you spend $100 on anything. The school district I was in was one of the poorest in the state, and most times the kids that won would get necessities, like clothes or school supplies. I can&#39;t imagine, being in one of the poorest districts, that he made very much money, and his selflessness and care for his students sticks with me to this day.</p>

			<p class="story__content">My middle school English teacher is one of the most wonderful people I&#39;ve ever met. I was in her class for 7th and 8th grade. Being her student for two years was a blessing. She was different and weird and wonderful and encouraged all her students to be themselves. I was also different and weird and didn&#39;t really fit in at school. I was picked on a lot and English class was my safe zone. I loved reading and writing and felt comfortable expressing myself because of my teacher. Over the course of two years, I found my voice and gained confidence in school.</p>
