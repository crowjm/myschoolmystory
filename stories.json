    "content": "One of the teachers I remember most is my 6th grade history teacher. His classes were so engaging and he made sure we understood our history and its consequences, not just names and dates. He was a former Marine and a steadfast believer in our right to free speech. I know at least two of my former classmates joined the Marines in some part because of his influence. One of the things I remember most was the lottery system he had. If you made at least a B on our weekly quiz, you could enter your name in the lottery. Once a month, he would pick the winner. If you won, he would take you to Walmart/Kmart/Target and let you spend $100 on anything. The school district I was in was one of the poorest in the state, and most times the kids that won would get necessities, like clothes or school supplies. I can't imagine, being in one of the poorest districts, that he made very much money, and his selflessness and care for his students sticks with me to this day."
